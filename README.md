# aws-playground-app

This project showcases how to use technologies like AWS CDK and AWS EKS to deploy a Quarkus application to AWS.
 
## Deploying the application to AWS

You can deploy this example to AWS via:
```shell script
./deploy.sh all
```

> **_NOTE:_**  This only works if you have configured AWS credentials on your system.
